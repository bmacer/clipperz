        Finding the perfect hairstyle can be a challenge, but understanding your
        face shape can make it easier to choose a flattering cut that
        accentuates your best features. In this guide, we'll help you identify
        your face shape and offer recommendations for hairstyles that will suit
        you best.
      </p>

      <div>
        <h3 class="face-shape-title">Oval Face Shape</h3>
        <img
          src="./assets/img/blog/oval-shaped-face.png"
          alt="Oval face shape example"
          class="img-fluid face-shape-img"
        />
        <p>
          Oval faces are characterized by a slightly longer length, with a
          forehead that is only a bit wider than the chin. This balanced shape
          is versatile and can pull off a variety of hairstyles. Classic short
          cuts, pompadours, and slicked-back styles work well for oval faces.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="face-shape-title">Round Face Shape</h3>
        <img
          src="./assets/img/blog/round-shaped-face.png"
          alt="Round face shape example"
          class="img-fluid face-shape-img"
        />
        <p>
          Round faces have a similar width and length, with full cheeks and a
          rounded chin. To create the illusion of a more elongated face, opt for
          hairstyles that add height and volume at the top, such as pompadours,
          quiffs, or faux hawks. Avoid cuts that are too short on the sides, as
          they can accentuate the roundness of your face.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="face-shape-title">Square Face Shape</h3>
        <img
          src="./assets/img/blog/square-shaped-face.png"
          alt="Square face shape example"
          class="img-fluid face-shape-img"
        />
        <p>
          Square faces feature a strong, angular jawline and a broad forehead.
          The width of the forehead, cheekbones, and jaw are nearly equal.
          Textured, layered cuts can help soften the angles of a square face.
          Both short and long hairstyles can work well, but avoid buzz cuts or
          anything too short on the sides.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="face-shape-title">Heart Face Shape</h3>
        <img
          src="./assets/img/blog/heart-shaped-face.png"
          alt="Heart face shape example"
          class="img-fluid face-shape-img"
        />
        <p>
          Heart-shaped faces have a wider forehead that tapers down to a
          narrower chin, often with prominent cheekbones. To balance the width
          at the top of your face, choose hairstyles that add volume and
          fullness around the jawline, such as a textured fringe, side-parted
          styles, or longer cuts with layers.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="face-shape-title">Diamond Face Shape</h3>
        <img
          src="./assets/img/blog/diamond-shaped-face.png"
          alt="Diamond face shape example"
          class="img-fluid face-shape-img"
        />
        <p>
          Diamond faces have a narrow forehead and jawline, with the cheekbones
          being the widest part of the face. To balance the narrowness at the
          top and bottom, opt for hairstyles that add width around the forehead,
          such as fringes or side-swept bangs. Layered cuts and textured styles
          can also help soften the cheekbones.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Remember, these are just guidelines, and the most important factor is
        choosing a hairstyle that makes you feel confident and comfortable. If
        you're still unsure about the best style for your face shape, don't
        hesitate to consult with our experienced barbers at Clipperz of
        Asheville. We're here to help you look and feel your best!

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout history, men's hairstyles have been an essential element of
        individual expression, societal trends, and cultural identity. As we
        take a journey through time, we'll explore how men's hairstyles have
        evolved across different eras and what influenced these changes.

      />
      <h3>Ancient Civilizations: Egypt, Greece, and Rome</h3>
      <p>
        In ancient Egypt, men often shaved their heads for practical reasons,
        such as hygiene and protection from lice. However, they also wore wigs
        made from human hair, animal hair, or plant fibers for special occasions
        or as status symbols. Men in ancient Greece and Rome sported a variety
        of hairstyles, from short and curly to long and straight, often adorned
        with wreaths or headbands.

      />
      <h3>The Middle Ages and Renaissance: Nobility and Knights</h3>
      <p>
        During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, men's hairstyles reflected
        social status and occupation. Noblemen and knights often wore their hair
        long and well-groomed, sometimes with elaborate braids or curls.
        Meanwhile, shorter hairstyles were common among the lower classes and
        those engaged in manual labor.

      />
      <h3>The 18th and 19th Centuries: Wigs, Powder, and Sideburns</h3>
      <p>
        The 18th century saw the rise of wigs and powdered hair, which were
        popular among European nobility and upper classes. Men's hairstyles in
        the 19th century shifted toward more natural looks, with sideburns and
        facial hair becoming popular. The Victorian era saw the emergence of the
        pompadour, a hairstyle characterized by a high, swept-back front, which
        remained popular into the early 20th century.

      <h3>The 20th Century: Diversity and Rebellion</h3>
      <p>
        The 20th century saw an explosion of diversity in men's hairstyles,
        reflecting shifting social values and the influence of popular culture.
        Key trends included the following:

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Undercuts:</strong> Characterized by short sides and a longer
          top, undercuts have become a versatile and popular choice for many
          men.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Man buns:</strong> Long hair gathered into a bun at the back
          of the head has seen a surge in popularity, particularly among hipster

        <li>
          <strong>Fades:</strong> Gradually tapering hair on the sides and back
          of the head, often combined with intricate designs, has become a
          staple in barbershops worldwide.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Natural textures:</strong> Embracing natural hair textures,
          such as curls and waves, has gained traction as more men prioritize
          hair health and low-maintenance styling.
